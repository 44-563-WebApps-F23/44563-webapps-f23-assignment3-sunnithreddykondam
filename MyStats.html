<h3>
    LMy favourite dish : Chicken Biryani
</h3>

<p>
    As a South Indian from hyderabad, it comes with no surprise that my favourite food is biryani. 
    The astounding flavours of spices and meat makes the dish the most craved dish in the world. 
    Cooked with perfect basmati rice and locally made ingredients, it is a staple diet for many from the region.
